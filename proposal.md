The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal. 

The main idea of our project is to create a program that asks the user questions, and depending on the given answers recommends a stock. We will explore finance equations, stock valuations, and other things. Our minimum viable product will be will be a program that will ask what industry you are interested in, and then recommend a stock in the industry based on other questions answered.  





Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals. 

Alec: One learning goal I have is to see how to manipulate stocks and understand the thought process behind making good financial decisions. I also want to understand the process of choosing stocks and how to automate/code said process.  

Jack: My learning goal is to get a better understanding of working with APIs. I had a hard time visualizing the data on our last project without being able to see it. This is another opportunity to work with this. 

Joint Learning: Our main goal is to learn how to integrate an algorithm, with an API, into Python code. Separately, this is an opportunity to learn time management with coding. This is something we both know we have struggled with in the past. 





Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further. 

Use an API from Yahoo finance to draw stock market data 

Create an algorithm to predict future stock prices 

Allow for user inputs on preferences for investments (industry, risk level, budget, timeline) 

Use these inputs to propose investments to the user from our algorithm 





Project Schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses. 

Week 1 

Create an API 

Create a layout for the code (function names and doc strings) 

Narrow down to exactly which industries we will be focusing on 

Week 2 

Start building the algorithm 

Code for the inputs 

Meet with finance faculty for opinions on how to do this 

Week 3 

Finish the algorithm 

Consult with finance faculty again 

Week 4 

Start integrating the algorithm into the code 

Week 5 

Finish the code 

Start working on the website 

Week 6 

Finish the website 





Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure. 

We will work in person together at the beginning, and then work individually to code. We chose this plan because we need to both understand the outline of the project. Once we do, we can divide and conquer the program to code on our own time as long as we keep the other person looped in. We also have biweekly meetings to review what has changed since the last meeting. 





Risks and Limitations: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success? 

The biggest threat will be time management and the complex financial tools used to value stocks. If we do not outline our plan with enough time, we will get stuck discussing how to best break down the Yahoo Finance API, and run out of time to code. The other problem of the financial tools is that it will be difficult to code. I have a good understanding of how to do these things on paper. Coding it will be more advanced, and I lack experience in that.  





Additional Course Content: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project? 

Financial news, stock projections, what stocks are the most popular to trade, risk management
